# p1-0 Repetition and Selection Practice

Create new NetBeans projects as you deem necessary to complete the exercises below.  Ensure that all new NetBeans projects are created inside the same directory where this repository was cloned.

(1) Write for loop statements that produce the following results (use a different for loop for each line).

```
1 12 23 34 45 56 67 78 89 100
27 32 37 42 47 52 57 62 67 72 77
32 25 18 11 4
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Blastoff!
27 13 -1 -15 -29 -43 -57 -71 -85 -99
```

(2) Write a program that asks the user to type in a year (e.g. 2009) and determines and outputs whether the year is a leap year or not.

(3) Write a program that asks the user to type in their mark in Computer Science. Depending on their input, print the appropriate output from this chart:

Mark | Output
--- | ---
< 0 | Invalid Mark
0 to 49 | Extra help is always available.
50 to 59 | Check that you understand all concepts.
60 to 69 | Your Grade is a C. Keep working hard!
70 to 79 | Your Grade is a B. Good work!
80 to 100 | You have earned an A. Congratulations
> 100 | Invalid Mark

(4) Write a program that first asks the user *how many* marks they will be entering. By using a for statement that counts from 1 to *how many*, allow the user to enter that quantity of marks. Keep a *total* of the numbers entered. Once all the numbers have been entered, calculate the average and print it out.
